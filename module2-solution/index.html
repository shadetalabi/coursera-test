			Coming out of my cageAnd I've been doing just fine
			Gotta gotta be down Because I want it all It started out with a kiss
			How did it end up like this?It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
			Now I'm falling asleep And she's calling a cab	While he's having a smoke
			And she's taking a drag Now they're going to bed And my stomach is sick
			And it's all in my head But she's touching his chest now

			Love is never any better than the lover. Wicked people love wickedly, violent people love violently, weak people love weakly, stupid people love stupidly, but the love of a free man is never safe. There is no gift for the beloved. The lover alone possesses his gift of love. The loved one is shorn, neutralized, frozen in the glare of the lover's inward eye.
